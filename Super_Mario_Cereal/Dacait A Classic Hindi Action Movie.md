The movie is available for free download on various online platforms[^1^] [^3^]. However, it is advised to watch the movie legally and support the original creators.

Dacait received mixed reviews from critics and audiences when it was released in 1987. Some praised the movie for its realistic portrayal of the rural life and the plight of the oppressed people. They also appreciated the performances of Sunny Deol, Rakhee Gulzar, Meenakshi Sheshadri and A.K. Hangal. Others criticized the movie for being too violent, melodramatic and formulaic. They also felt that the movie was a poor imitation of Sholay, the iconic dacoit movie of 1975. The movie was also compared to other dacoit movies of that era, such as Bandit Queen, Ghulami and Pratighaat.
 
Dacait was one of the movies that established Sunny Deol as an action hero in Bollywood. He displayed his trademark intensity and aggression in the role of Arjun Yadav, a man who becomes a rebel after losing his family. He also showed his romantic side in his scenes with Meenakshi Sheshadri, who played Javli, a village belle who falls in love with him. The chemistry between them was evident in their songs and scenes together. The movie also marked the debut of Urmila Matondkar, who played Arjun's sister Shanta. She was only 13 years old when she acted in the movie.
 
Dacait was a movie that tried to balance between art and commerce, realism and entertainment, social message and masala. It was a movie that reflected the socio-political scenario of India in the 1980s, where corruption, poverty and violence were rampant. It was also a movie that appealed to the masses with its catchy songs, thrilling action sequences and emotional drama. It was a movie that had everything going for it, but somehow failed to make a lasting impact on the box office or the viewers' minds.
